## Cafe tracker

### Brief description: 

I enjoy going to different cafes to study or relax. 
However, not every cafe is up to par with my expectations. Therefore, to avoid disappointment, 
I am creating a "cafe tracker" system that allows people around the globe to rate and give 
their honest feedback on different cafes based on their location, food, and, but not limited 
to, drinks. Additionally, because the reviews may become over saturated, it will be categorized 
based on highest, average, and lowest ratings. Ultimately, allowing a filter system to simplify
the usage of this "cafe tracker". This application targets people such as students, tourists, and
coffee enthusiasts.
