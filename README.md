## Coffee shop tracker

### Brief description: 
coffee shop
I enjoy going to different coffee shops to study or relax. 
However, because more and more coffee shops are opening, it becomes hard to remember the ones I have gone to. 
Therefore, to avoid going back to one that was not my favorite, I am creating a "coffee shop tracker" system that 
allows people to track and rate different coffee shops based on their location, food, and, but not limited 
to, drinks. Additionally, because the amount of reviews may become over saturated, it will be categorized 
based on highest, average, and lowest ratings. Ultimately, allowing a filter system to simplify
the usage of this "coffee shop tracker". This application targets people such as students, tourists, and
coffee enthusiasts. 


### A *bulleted* list:
#### User Stories: 
- As a user, I want to be able to add coffee shops to the tracker app
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a coffee shop
- As a user, I want to be able to see a list of all the coffee shop I have visited.
- As a user, I want to be able to rate the coffee shop on five stars.
- As a user, I want to be able to filter out the higher rating coffee shop.
- As a user, I want to be able to only have one rating per coffee shop, so no repeated ones.
